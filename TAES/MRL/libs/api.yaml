# MRL doenst support general purpose programming
# but allows the user to import functions implemented in other languages
# This example ilustrates an itegration with Pytho
# Python was chosen because it has great libraries for signal processing, but it could itegrate other languages too.

from python.api import call;
import numpy; 
import custom; # user defined module. Could be any name

function correlate(arg1*) -> call numpy.correlate args*; # this maps a mrl function to a numpy function
function age(date) -> call custom.age date; # this maps a mrl function to a function in the module custom.py

Python is one of the most popular programming languages to learn. The main function in Python acts as the point of execution for any program. Defining the main function in Python programming is a necessity to start the execution of the program as it gets executed only when the program is run directly and not executed when imported as a module.
What is Main Function in Python?
In most programming languages, there is a special function that is executed automatically every time the program is run. This is nothing but the main function or main() as it is usually denoted. It essentially serves as a starting point for the execution of a program.
In Python, it is not necessary to define the main function every time you write a program. This is because the Python interpreter executes grom the top of the file unless a specific function is defined. Hence, having a defined starting point for the execution of your Python program is useful to better understand how your program works.
In most Python programs/scripts, you might see a function definition, followed by a conditional statement that looks like the example shown below:

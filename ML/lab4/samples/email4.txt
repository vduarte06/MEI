Dearest Amanda,

I never knew how joyous life could be until I saw your face.
My heart leaps like a hummingbird in flight every time I see you.
This is something I have never felt before, and it is you that inspires it.

When I think about you and our rich conversations, I feel a warmness inside.
I cannot hide my smiles, even when we are apart.
This connection is special, amazing, and I dare say, destiny.

Many have asked what happened to create this new and better me.
I tell them, without hesitation, it is you.
Sometimes I feel like my heart will burst with all the longing and excitement I feel when I think of you.
Looking forward to our next date, beautiful.
May each be better than the last if that is even possible.

Sincerely,

Dave

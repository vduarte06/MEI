GitHub recently announced its new GitHub copilot tool and the internet was loaded with memes. 
There were speculations/talks that this would change the entire software development industry 
and everyone would be able to code out their products. GitHub copilot also faced backslashes 
when it was discovered that it had some security and privacy concerns including exposing API keys, 
reading private repositories code, etc.
GitHub market copilot as an "AI pair programmer" that could increase a developer’s coding efficiency. 
One would be able to get code suggestions on the go. It supports multiple programming languages 
and does very well with Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, Java, and Go. According to GitHub, 
the copilot is designed to understand more context than the usual code assistants.
The core of the copilot is created by OpenAI which had earlier released GPT-3, the world’s biggest 
NLP model (at the time of writing this article). The copilot is a subproduct of GPT-3, trained 
specifically on publically available code. The parent GPT-3 can also provide fairly good code results.
GPT-3 predicts the next word of a sentence given the previous words in a sentence. It completes
 the given prompt to the number of tokens specified. The copilot is based on suggesting what 
 could be the next piece of code based on the current variables used/declared.
The comparison between the two may seem a bit unfair, but, it will be interesting to 
see how these two models perform. I am more proficient with Python, and therefore, all 
the code snippets would be created in Python language.
Round 1: Write a program to perform a binary search
Let’s with a basic concept whose code should be available in abundance over the internet, 
Binary Search. Let’s start with GitHub copilot.
The copilot has an interactive and easy way to follow long writing code. 
Supported in VS code IDE, one needs to install the copilot VS code extension 
and then authenticate to a GitHub account that has technical preview access.
 I have got the early access and therefore, can proceed with getting code suggestions in my VS code IDE.
Here is the result from copilot for binary search

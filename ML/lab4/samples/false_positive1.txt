Dear Mr Richardson,

I am writing to ask whether your caf√© may like to donate a voucher for the local 
primary school's upcoming trivia night scheduled for 30 March. We hope to raise 
enough money at the trivia night to purchase new recorders for our school's music
program. We will give prizes to the top three teams and include other items in a silent auction.

Any donation would be gratefully received. It may be as small as coffee and cake 
for two or as generous as a $100 dining voucher that a family could use for lunch. 
In exchange for your generosity, we would place an advertisement for your business
 on our answer sheets. If you could provide a poster, we would also happily hang 
 this in our school hall on our trivia night.

Thank you for your time reading this letter and considering our request. 
If you'd like to donate or need more information, you can call or email me using 
the contact details above. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Kind regards

Carol Williams
